# Hello, there!

I’m Chanukya Venepally, a graduate student at SMU Guildhall and a graphics programming enthusiast. I enjoy games that are visually stunning and of course, ones with solid gameplay.

Right now, I’m building a custom C++ game engine that supports both Direct3D 11 and Direct3D 12 (in progress). It also uses FMOD for audio and tinyXML2 for XML parsing. I’ve built a few games using this engine which you can find in my repositories.

## What I'm working on
- Adding Direct3D 12 support to my engine while maintaining DX11 compatibility
- Researching ReSTIR and other ray tracing techniques as part of my thesis work
- Developing a capstone game in Unreal Engine 5 with a 28-person team (7 programmers)
