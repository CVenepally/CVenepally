# Hello, there!

I'm **Chanukya Venepally**, graduate student at SMU Guildhall and a fellow Graphics enthusiast. I like games that visually stunning (*and obviously, good gameplay elements!*).
---
I'm currently working on a __Custom C++ Engine__ with Direct3D 11 Graphics API (DX12 soon) along with FMOD for audio and tinyXML2 for XML parsing. I've also made a few games 
using that engine, you can find them in my reprositories.

## What am I doing right now?
- Currently adding support for Direct3D 12 in my engine.
- Researching about ReSTIR and other raytracing solutions to implement in my engine as a part of my thesis.
- Working on our capstone game using Unreal Engine 5 with a team of 28 people (7 programmers).
